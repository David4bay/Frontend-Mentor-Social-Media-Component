## Overview

This is a very good challenge as I was faced with keeping track of elements as variable for the different color schemes of the project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process

I took the mobile-first approach using flexbox and then set a media query for screen sizes above 1200px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more DOM manipulation methods in this project, as keeping track of DOM nodes is necessary if styling differently according to the themes' selected.

### Useful resources

- [Ese Alli Github](https://github.com/EseAlli/social-media-dashboard) - Her JavaScript solution was very useful in leading me to the right direction in making my own.
